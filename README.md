## :sassy_man:  About me
* Student at Computer Science & Artifactual Intelligence at Helwan University and my graduation project is about Diabetic Retinopathy Detection, which classifies fundus retina images according to the degree of injury, through the flow of image processing for enhancing images to improve features extraction using a deep learning approach "CNN".

* During my college levels, I worked on many projects and investigated a variety of datasets in different industries to explore historical data and help to improve their sales and answer their questions and support their decisions by emphasizing my analytics with some insights, Data Mining, and Machine Learning techniques like regression models, time series and association role in the market basket.

* I have learning agility and enhanced analytical and problem-solving skills, advanced knowledge of applied mathematics and statistics, and I believe that my level of education helps me to build a strong career.
